            </p><br>

            <h3>Control of intestinal dysbiosis:</h3>
            <p> Intestinal dysbiosis is a condition where the natural balance of microorganisms in the
                intestine is altered, causing various <br>
                gastrointestinal disorders. Controlling dysbiosis is crucial for maintaining digestive
                health, improving patient comfort, and contributing <br>
                to overall well-being, even in cases of chronic intestinal disorders like irritable bowel
                syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis.</p><br>

            <h3>Immediate and prolonged restoration of intestinal flora:</h3>
            <p>CDS22-formula is ideal for both acute and chronic episodes of intestinal dysbiosis. It
                reduces the severity and duration of symptoms, <br>
                improving patient comfort and accelerating recovery. It is particularly indicated for
                supporting intestinal health and can be beneficial in <br>
                cases of temporary or chronic intestinal disorders characterized by accelerated transit that
                prevents normal daily activities or <br>
                adequate night rest.</p><br>

            <h3>Variety of Dosages:</h3>
            <p>Available in different formats and dosages to support intestinal health and adapt to
                individual dietary needs, offering flexibility to <br>
                healthcare professionals in personalizing supplementation</p><br>

            <h3>Original Formulation:</h3>
            <p>CDS22-formula is the original FormulazionDe Simone, a unique combination of proprietary
                bacterial strains designed to maximize <br>
                intestinal well-being. The strains are cultivated and maintained in proprietary Master Cell
                Banks, ensuring purity, quality, and <br>
                consistency in every production</p><br>

            <h3>Guaranteed Safety:</h3>
            <p>Every dose has been tested to ensure maximum efficacy and safety. Thanks to a short supply
                chain approved by the inventor, the <br>
                product maintains the highest quality standards from raw material to packaging</p><br>

            <h3>Affordability:</h3>
            <p>CDS22-formula offers superior value compared to probiotics containing equivalent quantities
                of bacteria. Efficient production and <br>
                direct cost control allow us to offer a more affordable product on the market</p> <br>

                    The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the result of pioneering research by
                    Professor Claudio De Simone (MD, FAGA), who redefined <br>
                    therapeutic approaches to intestinal health by introducing the use of high concentration probiotic
                    mixtures to dietetically manage acute and chronic <br>
                    gastrointestinal disorders. <br> <br>

                    mixtures to dietetically manage acute and chronic <br>
                    gastrointestinal disorders. <br> <br>
                    His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the importance of the
                    intestinal flora s role was just beginning to be <br>
                    understood. Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the American College of Gastroenterology
                    and, after graduating in Medicine and <br>
                    Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical immunology. He taught Infectious
                    Diseases at the University of L’Aquila (Italy). <br>

                        Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in the 1990s, the Professor
                        has actively advocated for better regulation and quality <br>
                        control of probiotics, highlighting the potential health and well-being risks. <br>


                        As emphasized by Professor De Simone in numerous conferences and publications, many marketed
                        probiotics have not been clinically tested or may not <br>
                        correspond to the original clinically tested formulations when marketed, causing substantial
                        differences in the safety and efficacy of the final product (De <br>
                        Simone C. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 16 No. 9 2018). <br><br>


                        Current regulations often do not require thorough comparative studies to ensure that changes in
                        manufacturing processes do not compromise the efficacy and <br>
                        safety of the commercially distributed probiotic produc <br>
